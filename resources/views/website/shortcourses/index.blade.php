                        <h3>Our Short Courses</h3>
                        <p>We offer flexible courses designed to cater to various disciplines within Geographic
                            Information Systems (GIS).
                            At the heart of our curriculum is the compulsory course, 'Basic to GIS', which serves as an
                            introduction
                            to beginners in the field. This foundational course provides participants with exposure to a
                            wide array of
                            tools, including both commercial and open-source software, as well as field mapping tools.
                        </p>

                        <p>Additionally, we offer specialized courses tailored to specific disciplines such as Wildlife
                            Management, Marine GIS, and Land Management, among others. These courses are crafted to
                            address
                            the unique needs and applications of each field, providing participants with targeted skills
                            and
                            knowledge.
                        </p>
